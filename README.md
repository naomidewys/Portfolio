<h1>README - Practice Project: Portfolio</h1>
<h3>Intro</h3>
This is a multi-page portfolio showcasing my start in learning tech. It was the final project for <a href="https://shecodes.io" target="_blank">SheCodes Responsive</a>, a five-week course
teaching responsive design. The requirements for this project was to create a multi-page portfolio with the following sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    HTML/CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    Flexbox
  </li>
  <li>
    Bootstrap
  </li>
  <li>
    Netlify
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>
When the user first loads the portfolio, it shows the homepage. On the homepage, there is a navigation banner, 
which changes to a hamburger menu on smaller devices, a greeting and small intro, a button to learn more, and images of other starter projects. Clicking on the home link in the navigation
banner will direct the user back to this homepage.
</p>
<p>
  On the About page, this is a brief intro about myself and a profile picture. Underneath, there are sections on my skills, my experience (with certificates), and "coming soon" training programs I wish to participate in soon.
</p>
<p>
  On the Projects page, there are images and descriptions of my completed projects and a short comment about this portfolio being part of a final project for SheCodes Responsive.
  There is also a mention of upcoming projects in the works.
</p>
<p>
  On the Contact page, there is a description of how to connect with me (e.g., LinkedIn, email) and view my open-sourced projects on GitHub.
  There is also a message about my interest in organizations that support inclusivity and diversity.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, on each of the pages, there is a footer at the bottom of the page with additional contact links so the user has a way to access my contact information regardless of what page they're currently viewing.
</p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
As this was my first multi-page project, I started by outlining what pages I needed, what info they would contain, and what needed to be present on each page
consistently (navigation bar, contact footer, etc).</p>
<p>
  From there, I started by working on each page individually, starting with the home page and working through to the contact page. I added a placeholder header and footer until I could determine specifics and ensure consistently across all pages.
</p>
<p>As Flexbox and Bootstrap were new to me, I struggled with getting the layout of images how I wanted them and ensuring image sizes were consistent without creating any distortions.</p>
<p>I also think I was a bit over-ambitious for my first portfolio, as there will be a lot to manage and maintain on this portfolio as my skills grow. For this reason, I've decided to use this as a temporary portfolio
until I can create something simpler and more streamlined.</p>
<p>I also struggled with adding more info to the Contact page to ensure the full page showed the website rather than having empty space at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<h3>Learnings</h3>
<p>
  In this project, I learned what considerations are necessary for responsive and accessible design. Everything from typography, colors, font sizes,
  layout of information and how it appears on different screen sizes are all important. I also learned how I can check different device views in the Inspect view.
</p>
<p>
  I learned that Flexbox is a great way to manipulate elements, and this is something I look forward to practicing more.
</p>
<p>As this was my first multi-page project, I also learned how easy it can be for inconsistency to creep in. Making note of things like image sizes and font sizes
  and using classes and ids is important to ensure consistency across all pages.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>These are some improvements I would like to work on next time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I would make the code cleaner and less complicated. E.g., not so many "coming soon" elements that need constant updating.</li>
  <li>I would adjust UX for larger screens (computer monitors vs. laptop screens).</li>
  <li>Since this was a project for a workshop, I kept it multi-page. However, I would like to make a single page portfolio next time. I think based on my current skill range,
  emphasizing a well-executed and simpler design would be a great way to show my skills and personality.</li>
</ul>
